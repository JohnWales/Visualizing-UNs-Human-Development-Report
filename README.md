# Visualizing UN's Human Development Report

## Abstract

Upward trends were seen in various indicators in countries throughout the planet, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. While these figures have undoubtedly taken a hit during these unprecedented times, by creating a tool to track these statistics, pre-COVID data can be both preserved and visualised and use it as a means to track post-pandemic recovery. Multiple international businesses have been forced into liquidation, affecting everyone around the world. Unfortunately for this project, the data for 2020 and 2021 is not yet available. When this data gets releases it will be a great addition to the project, but for now, users can only access data as far as 2019. 

There are a countless number of findings received through the individual use of the application. The app allows users to come up with their own findings, as there are a number of different ways that the data can be visualised. Users can experiment with the visualizations, possibly discovering interesting correlations they may not have known existed. This project aims to educate people on countries around the world in an enjoyable way. Topics such as this are extremely important as to how it shapes the world in which we live in.

The United Nations have created an application where they also visualised the Human Development Report, but up until recently they have privatised it. Users must now pay for this product in order to use it. The aim of this project was to provide free access for users to visualise the same data. Everyone should have the right to freely access an application such as this, hence why it was created.
