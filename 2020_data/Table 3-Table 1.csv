,Definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Human Development Index (HDI): A composite index measuring average achievement in three basic dimensions of human developmentâ€”a long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living. See Technical note 1 at http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2020_technical_notes.pdf  for details on how the HDI is calculated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI): HDI value adjusted for inequalities in the three basic dimensions of human development. See Technical note 2 at http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2020_technical_notes.pdf  for details on how the IHDI is calculated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Overall loss: Percentage difference between the IHDI value and the HDI value.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Difference from HDI rank: Difference in ranks on the IHDI and the HDI, calculated only for countries for which an IHDI value is calculated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Coefficient of human inequality: Average inequality in the three basic dimensions of human development.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Inequality in life expectancy: Inequality in distribution of expected length of life based on data from life tables estimated using the Atkinson inequality index. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Inequality-adjusted life expectancy index: HDI life expectancy index value adjusted for inequality in distribution of expected length of life based on data from life tables listed in Main data sources.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Inequality in education: Inequality in distribution of years of schooling based on data from household surveys estimated using the Atkinson inequality index.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Inequality-adjusted education index: HDI education index value adjusted for inequality in distribution of years of schooling based on data from household surveys listed in Main data sources.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Inequality in income: Inequality in income distribution based on data from household surveys estimated using the Atkinson inequality index.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Inequality-adjusted income index: HDI income index value adjusted for inequality in income distribution based on data from household surveys listed in Main data sources.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Income shares (%): Percentage share of income (or consumption) that accrues to the indicated population subgroups.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Income share held by richest 1%: Share of pretax national income held by the richest 1 percent of the population. Pre-tax national income is the sum of all pretax personal income flows accruing to the owners of the production factors, labour and capital, before the tax/transfer system is taken into account and after the pension system is taken into account.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Gini coefficient: Measure of the deviation of the distribution of income among individuals or households in a country from a perfectly equal distribution. A value of 0 represents absolute equality, a value of 100 absolute inequality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
