,"Three-colour coding is used to visualize partial grouping of countries and aggregates by indicator. For each indicator countries are divided into three groups of approximately equal size (terciles): the top third, the middle third and the bottom third. Aggregates are colour coded using the same tercile cutoffs. See Technical note 6 at http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2020_technical_notes.pdf for details about partial grouping in this table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,a. This column is intentionally left without colour because it is meant to provide context for the indicator on change in forest area.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,b. Data refer to the most recent year available during the period specified.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,DEFINITIONS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Fossil fuel energy consumption: Percentage of total energy consumption that comes from fossil fuels, which consist of coal, oil, petroleum and natural gas products.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Carbon dioxide emissions, production emissions: Total carbon dioxide emissions produced as a consequence of human activities (use of coal, oil and gas for combustion and industrial processes, gas flaring and cement manufacture), divided by midyear population. Values are territorial emissions, meaning that emissions are attributed to the country in which they physically occur. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Carbon dioxide emissions, per unit of GDP: Human-originated carbon dioxide emissions stemming from the burning of fossil fuels, gas flaring and cement manufacture, expressed in kilograms per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) in constant 2010 US dollars. Carbon dioxide emitted by forest biomass through depletion of forest areas is included.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Forest area: Land spanning more than 0.5 hectare with trees taller than 5 metres and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It excludes land predominantly under agricultural or urban land use, tree stands in agricultural production systems (for example, in fruit plantations and agroforestry systems) and trees in urban parks and gardens. Areas under reforestation that have not yet reached but are expected to reach a canopy cover of 10 percent and a tree height of 5 metres are included, as are temporarily unstocked areas resulting from human intervention or natural causes that are expected to regenerate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Fresh water withdrawals: Total fresh water withdrawn, expressed as a percentage of total renewable water resources.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Use of fertilizer nutrient: Total agricultural use of fertilizer nutrient—nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (expressed as P2O5), expressed per area of cropland. Cropland is the sum of arable land and land under permanent crops.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Domestic material consumption per capita: The sum of direct imports of materials and domestic extraction of materials minus direct exports of materials, measured in tonnes, divided by midyear population. A territorial (production-side) indicator, domestic material consumption measures the total amount of materials used in economic processes. It excludes materials that are mobilized during domestic extraction but do not enter the economic process. Domestic material consumption per capita, also referred to as metabolic profile, is an environmental pressure indicator that describes the average level of material use in an economy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution: Number of deaths attributable to the joint effects of household and ambient air pollution, expressed per 100,000 population. The rates are age-standardized. The diseases taken into account are acute respiratory infections (estimated for all ages), cerebrovascular diseases (estimated for adults older than age 25), ischaemic heart diseases (estimated for adults older than age 25), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (estimated for adults older than age 25) and lung cancer (estimated for adults older than age 25).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Mortality rate attributed to unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene services: Number of deaths due to diarrhoea, intestinal nematode infections and protein-energy malnutrition that are attributable to inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene services, expressed per 100,000 population. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Number of deaths and missing persons attributed to disasters: Number of people who died during or directly after a disaster as a direct result of the event or whose whereabouts are unknown since the event, expressed per 100,000 population. It includes people who are presumed dead, for whom there is no physical evidence such as a body and for whom an official or legal report has been filed with competent authorities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Degraded land: Rain-fed cropland, irrigated cropland, or range, pasture, forest and woodlands that have experienced the reduction or loss of biological or economic productivity and complexity resulting from a combination of pressures, including land use and management practices, expressed as a percentage of total land area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Red List Index: Measure of the aggregate extinction risk across groups of species. It is based on genuine changes in the number of species in each category of extinction risk on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species. It ranges from 0, all species categorized as extinct, to 1, all species categorized as least concern.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
