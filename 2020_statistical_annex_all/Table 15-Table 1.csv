"ICERD: International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, 1965: Prohibits all forms of racial discriminationâdefined as any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the equal recognition, enjoyment or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms and sets out the obligations of the state to combat this phenomenon. The Convention also requires a state to take appropriate measures against racial discrimination, including the propagation of racist ideas advocated by groups and organizations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ICCPR: International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966: Says that all individuals possess civil and political rights, starting with the right to self-determination and including the right to life, the right to liberty and freedom of movement, the freedom of religion, of speech and of assembly, the right to equality between men and women, the right to equality before the law and the right to effective legal recourse. Some of these rights, such as the right not to be arbitrarily deprived of oneâs life, freedom from torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, may not be suspended or derogated even in a state of emergency. The ICCPR, its optional protocols, the ICESCR and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights together form the International Bill of Human Rights.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ICESCR: International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 1966: Establishes economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to work in just and favourable conditions, to social protection, to an adequate standard of living, to the highest attainable standards of physical and mental health, to education, to participate in cultural life, and to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress.

"CEDAW: Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, 1979: Is the first global and comprehensive legally binding international treaty aimed at the elimination of all forms of sex-based discrimination against women. It requires states to incorporate the principle of gender equality in their national constitutions or other appropriate legislation and to ensure the practical realisation of that principle. Discrimination against women is defined as any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"CAT: Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 1984: Defines and outlaws torture and other forms of ill-treatment under all circumstances, requires states to criminalize it under domestic law, to prevent its occurrence, to properly educate their law enforcement and other personnel about the prohibition of torture, to impartially investigate allegations of torture and to offer fair and adequate compensation to any victim. The Convention clearly states that no circumstances of any kind, including orders from a superior, a state of war or a state of emergency, can justify an act of torture â the ban is absolute. States commit to not extradite, deport or refoule a person if they are at risk of being tortured in the territory to which they would return, and to the universal obligation to prosecute or extradite any individual accused of having committed torture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"CRC: Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989: Defines a child as a person under the age of 18, unless national law sets a lower age of majority, and sets standards for health, education, legal, civil, and social services for children in accordance with four general principles: non-discrimination between children; the best interest of the child; the right to life, survival and development of the child; and respect for the views of the child. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ICMW: International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, 1990: Establishes minimum standards that states should apply to migrant workers and members of their families, regardless of their migratory status.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"CRC-AC: Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, 2000: Requires states to take all feasible measures to ensure that members of their armed forces under the age of 18 do not take a direct part in hostilities, to ban compulsory recruitment below the age of 18, to ensure any voluntary member of the armed forces under the age of 18 does not take direct part in hostilities and to take legal measures to prohibit independent armed groups from recruiting and using children under the age of 18 in conflicts. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"CRC-SC: Optional Protocol on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, 2000: Prohibits the sale of children for sexual and non-sexual purposes, child prostitution and child pornography and provides states with detailed requirements to end the exploitation and abuse of children. It requires ratifying states to provide legal and other support to child victims and to criminalise and punish the activities related to these offences not only for those offering or delivering children for any of the purposes, but also for anyone accepting the child for these activities. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ICPED: The International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, 2006: Prohibits enforced disappearance, defined as the abduction or deprivation of liberty of a person by state authorities, followed by the denial of those authorities to disclose the whereabouts or fate of the person, and establishes minimum legal standards on its prevention, combating impunity, effective law enforcement and upholding the rights of victims. The convention also enshrines the right of victims to the truth and to reparations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"CRPD: The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2006: Guarantees the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms to persons with disabilities and promotes respect for their inherent dignity. It considers disability as the result of an interaction between an individualâs condition and an inaccessible society. The barriers that can make society inaccessible are manifold and the Convention identifies these barriers as discriminatory and requires their removal. In adopting a rights-based approach to disability, the Convention moves away from viewing disability as a sickness inherent in the individual requiring either a medical intervention (medical approach) to fix the person, or a charitable intervention (charity approach) based on voluntary assistance rather than individual right.
