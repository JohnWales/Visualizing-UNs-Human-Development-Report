Notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a. Not all indicators were available for all countries, so caution should be used in cross-country comparisons. When an indicator is missing, weights of available indicators are adjusted to total 100 percent. See Technical note 5 at http://hdr.undp.org/en/2020-MPI for details.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b. D indicates data from Demographic and Health Surveys, M from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, N from national surveys and P from Pan Arab Population and Family Health Surveys (see http://hdr.undp.org/en/faq-page/multidimensional-poverty-index-mpi for the list of national surveys).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
c. Data refer to the most recent year available during the period specified.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
d. Missing indicator on nutrition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e. Value is not reported because it is based on a small number of multidimensionally poor people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f. Missing indicator on child mortality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
g. Considers child deaths that occurred at any time because the survey did not collect the date of child deaths.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
h. The methodology was adjusted to account for missing indicator on nutrition and incomplete indicator on child mortality (the survey did not collect the date of child deaths).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i. Based on the version of data accessed on 7 June 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"j. Given the information available in the data, child mortality was constructed based on deaths that occurred between surveys- that is, between 2012 and 2014. Child deaths reported by an adult man in the household were taken into account because the date of death was reported.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
k. Missing indicator on housing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
l. Missing indicator on cooking fuel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
m. Missing indicator on electricity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"n. Multidimensional Poverty Index estimates are based on the 2016 National Health and Nutrition Survey. Estimates based on the 2015 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey are 0.010 for Multidimensional Poverty Index value, 2.6 for multidimensional poverty headcount (%), 3,207,000 for multidimensional poverty headcount in year of survey, 3,281,000 for projected multidimensional poverty headcount in 2018, 40.2 for intensity of deprivation, 0.4 for population in severe multidimensional poverty, 6.1 for population vulnerable to multidimensional poverty, 39.9 for contribution of deprivation in health, 23.8 for contribution of deprivation in education and 36.3 for contribution of deprivation in standard of living.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
o. Captures only deaths of children under age 5 who died in the last five years and deaths of children ages 12–18 years who died in the last two years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
p. Sanitation follows the national classification in which pit latrine with slab is considered unimproved.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
q. Missing indicator on school attendance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Multidimensional Poverty Index: Percentage of the population that is multidimensionally poor adjusted by the intensity of the deprivations. See Technical note 5 at http://hdr.undp.org/en/2020-MPI for details on how the Multidimensional Poverty Index is calculated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Multidimensional poverty headcount: Population with a deprivation score of at least 33 percent. It is expressed as a share of the population in the survey year, the number of multidimensionally poor people in the survey year and the projected number of multidimensionally poor people in 2018.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Intensity of deprivation of multidimensional poverty: Average deprivation score experienced by people in multidimensional poverty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Inequality among the poor: Variance of individual deprivation scores of poor people. It is calculated by subtracting the deprivation score of each multidimensionally poor person from the average intensity, squaring the differences and dividing the sum of the weighted squares by the number of  multidimensionally poor people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Population in severe multidimensional poverty: Percentage of the population in severe multidimensional poverty—that is, those with a deprivation score of 50 percent or more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Population vulnerable to multidimensional poverty: Percentage of the population at risk of suffering multiple deprivations—that is, those with a deprivation score of 20–33 percent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Contribution of deprivation in dimension to overall multidimensional poverty: Percentage of the Multidimensional Poverty Index attributed to deprivations in each dimension.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Population living below national poverty line: Percentage of the population living below the national poverty line, which is the poverty line deemed appropriate for a country by its authorities. National estimates are based on population-weighted subgroup estimates from household surveys.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Population living below PPP $1.90 a day: Percentage of the population living below the international poverty line of $1.90 (in purchasing power parity [PPP] terms) a day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
