,"Three-colour coding is used to visualize partial grouping of countries and aggregates by indicator. For each indicator countries are divided into three groups of approximately equal size (terciles): the top third, the middle third and the bottom third. Aggregates are colour coded using the same tercile cutoffs. See Technical note 6 at http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2020_technical_notes.pdf for details about partial grouping in this table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Adjusted net savings: Net national savings plus education expenditure and minus energy depletion, mineral depletion, net forest depletion, and carbon dioxide and particulate emissions damage. Net national savings are equal to gross national savings less the value of consumption of fixed capital. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Total debt service: Sum of principal repayments and interest actually paid in currency, goods or services on long-term debt; interest paid on short-term debt; and repayments (repurchases and charges) to the International Monetary Fund. It is expressed as a percentage of exports of goods, services and primary income.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Gross capital formation: Outlays on additions to the fixed assets of the economy plus net changes in inventories. Fixed assets include land improvements (such as fences, ditches and drains); plant, machinery and equipment purchases; and construction of roads, railways and the like, including schools, offices, hospitals, private residential dwellings and commercial and industrial buildings. Inventories are stocks of goods held by firms to meet temporary or unexpected fluctuations in production or sales as well as goods that are work in progress. Net acquisitions of valuables are also considered capital formation. Gross capital formation was formerly known as gross domestic investment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Skilled labour force: Percentage of the labour force ages 15 and older with intermediate or advanced education, as classified by the International Standard Classification of Education. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Concentration index (exports): A measure of the degree of product concentration in exports from a country (also referred to as the Herfindahl-Hirschmann Index). A value closer to 0 indicates that a country's exports are more homogeneously distributed among a series of products (reflecting a well diversified economy); a value closer to 1 indicates that a country's exports are highly concentrated among a few products.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Research and development expenditure: Current and capital expenditures (both public and private) on creative work undertaken systematically to increase knowledge, including knowledge of humanity, culture and society, and the use of knowledge for new applications. Research and development covers basic research, applied research and experimental development.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Old–age dependency ratio: Ratio of the population ages 65 and older to the population ages 15–64, expressed as the number of dependants per 100 people of working age (ages 15–64).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Military expenditures: All current and capital expenditures on the armed forces, including peacekeeping forces; defence ministries and other government agencies engaged in defence projects; paramilitary forces, if these are judged to be trained and equipped for military operations; and military space activities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Ratio of education and health expenditure to military expenditure: Sum of government expenditure on education and health divided by military expenditure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Overall loss in HDI value due to inequality, average annual change: Annual compound change rate of the overall loss in Human Development Index (HDI) value due to inequality over 2010–2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Gender Inequality Index, average annual change: Annual compound change rate of the Gender Inequality Index value over 2005–2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Income share of the poorest 40%, average annual change: Annual compound change rate of the income share of the poorest 40 percent of the population over 2005–2018.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
